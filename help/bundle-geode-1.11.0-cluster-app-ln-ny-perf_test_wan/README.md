# Bundle: WAN

The `wan` bundle includes two (2) local clusters configured with bi-directional WAN gateways. You can test the bundle immediately after installation. No configurations required.

To understand how the clusters are configured, please the following the WAN example article. It provides step-by-step instructions for creating and running WAN enabled clusters from scratch.

[https://github.com/javapark1/geode-addon/blob/master/doc/WAN-Example.md](https://github.com/javapark1/geode-addon/blob/master/doc/WAN-Example.md)

## Installing Bundle

```console
install_bundle -download bundle-geode-1.11.0-cluster-app-ln-ny-perf_test_wan.tar.gz
```

## Running Clusters

Add a locator and two members to both clusters.

```console
# ny
switch_cluster ny
add_locator
add_member
add_member

# ln
switch_cluster ln
add_locator
add_member
add_member
```

Run the clusters.

```console
start_cluster -cluster ny
start_cluster -cluster ln
```

## Monitoring Clusters

The clusters can be monitored in a number of ways, i.e., by Pulse, gfsh, VSD, JMX, Grafana, geode-addon, etc. Let's use Pulse for our example. You can view the gateway sender activities from Pulse. To get the Pulse URLs for both clusters run the following:

```console
show_cluster -long -cluster ny
show_cluster -long -cluster ln
```

You should see the following URLs from the command outputs.

- ny: [http://localhost:7070/pulse](http://localhost:7070/pulse)
- ln: [http://localhost:7080/pulse](http://localhost:7080/pulse)

## Running `perf_test_wan`

The included `perf_test_wan` app is the same `perf_test` app that you can also create by running the `create_app` command. There are no configuration differences between the two. Either one will properly populate data into both clusters.

The `perf_test_wan` app connects to the `ny` cluster so the `ny` cluster is the sender and `ln` is the receiver.

Change directory into the `perf_test_wan`'s `bin_sh` directory.

```console
cd_app perf_test_wan; cd bin_sh
```

First, ingest data into the `eligibility` and `profile` regions. 

```console
./test_ingestion -run
```

Next, generate transactional data into the `summary` region which is configured to replicate between the clusters.

```console
./test_tx -run
```

## Replicating from `ln` to `ny`

If you want to send from the `ln` cluster to the `ny` cluster then change the locator port in the `client-cache.xml` file.

```console
cd_app perf_test_wan
vi etc/client-cache.xml
```

Change the locator port number from 10333 (ny) to 10344 (ln).

```xml
<pool name="serverPool">
   <locator host="localhost" port="10344" />
</pool>
```

Run `test_tx` as before.

```console
cd bin_sh
./test_tx -run
```

## Tearing Down

```console
stop_cluster -all -cluster ny
stop_cluster -all -cluster ln
```
